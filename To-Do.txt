Figure out best way to validate data

Confirm family_id format is correct, it usually shows one or two individuals with the same number in that column, Silveus said that it was alright, just wanna look into
it and see if there's an individual ID that would be helpful.  

Crosswalk Inspection
Mobility Crosswalk was problematic, and now empty. There wasn't a clean variable question for anything other than 2001 if I remember right. The four reasons for leaving

Make some preliminary graphs of the data that might be interesting to the research 

Remind myself of the correct way to track variables per year, go through each crosswalk



1/14
Data validation and preliminary graphing of variables of interest to the research. Find where the more fully compiled crosswalks live on my computer, upload them to the github
1 Find thorough xwalks on laptop (tonight)
2 Brief data chart analysis
3 Confirm the variable names and paths in the xwalks
4 Further brief chart analysis
Add Dr. Silveus to the github

Data validation and preliminary graphing of variables of interest to the research
Reading through panel compilation code
log hours

I've been using git version control for this project and for the script that compiles the data set
	I like this because it is easier to display in a project portfolio for software and data jobs, 
	I'm also very familiar with the way that it works

I set up the environment for R and github on this computer, I was mostly using the other one

I ran the script to observe the compiled data, I had emailed Silveus earlier asking for his preliminary input, and he said that it was looking as he expected. 

I'm doing some work for data validation, there are some variables on the PSID that seemingly don't track from year to year, and I'm trying to keep track of that 
as well as compiling a list of those instances that my excel sheets that I compiled that track the variables per year are correct, and data display




Put that meeting in the reminders
Definitely could get a couple hours for before the silveus meeting in this weekend... Do that tomorrow perhaps a little bit and also do that before
