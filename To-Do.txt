Hello Dr. Silveus
MEETING:
***

Pulling behavior from individual

Total : religious : nonreligious

visualizations of church attendance with these philanthropy behavior

volunteering and giving

have a version of the data without religious moving reasons

how many moved for work 

have you moved to a different state
Create characteristics by type of move

I know that it's been a minute since meeting, so I'm excited to share progress
and also take some time and make sure that I'm aligned to what you are expecting

There's two variables in the panel that I don't have
there is no single permanent code for total family income across all years. 


I've started some graphing of basic variables, I can keep doing that if wanted
and when there's more direction

The philantropy data request is very robust

I recently realized I was anchoring on the wrong ER code for family_id,
I recently changed it and started doing some analysis

I can add you to the project repository as well as show some of the git
commands to be able to contribute once I am off the project if it needs 
any maintenance

Tonight:

Test Panel construction on personal computer before meeting / log an hour for't

Implement Boerigter suggestions, start using the workflow for connections

Taco night!!
And Pulls and Pushs

I've just also gotta make sure that I'm not missing anything in class thats 

Figure out best way to validate data



1/22 Meeting

1/21
Two hours before meeting

Wait until back in office / fifteen minutes

Can't find the total income or the current state / former might be geo restricted

Gave some age graphs, fixed the parquet I think, should be ready to meet  






maybe just make the parquet and email to myself 
before I leave

1/20
Still validating data and the way that it's formatted.

Get Neil Silveus on this github, show him how to clone and push... I'll bet he likes that stuff

Get LLM input on how exactly to do all that, start on the last chat when you pick it up again

log hours

SUA working / compile lead of job leads / 

Confirm family_id format is correct, it usually shows one or two individuals with the same number in that column, Silveus said that it was alright, just wanna look into
it and see if there's an individual ID that would be helpful.  

Crosswalk Inspection
Mobility Crosswalk was problematic, and now empty. There wasn't a clean variable question for anything other than 2001 if I remember right. The four reasons for leaving

Make some preliminary graphs of the data that might be interesting to the research 

Remind myself of the correct way to track variables per year, go through each crosswalk



1/14
Data validation and preliminary graphing of variables of interest to the research. Find where the more fully compiled crosswalks live on my computer, upload them to the github
1 Find thorough xwalks on laptop (tonight)
2 Brief data chart analysis
3 Confirm the variable names and paths in the xwalks
4 Further brief chart analysis
Add Dr. Silveus to the github

1/13
Data validation and preliminary graphing of variables of interest to the research
Reading through panel compilation code
log hours

1/12

I've been using git version control for this project and for the script that compiles the data set
	I like this because it is easier to display in a project portfolio for software and data jobs, 
	I'm also very familiar with the way that it works

I set up the environment for R and github on this computer, I was mostly using the other one

I ran the script to observe the compiled data, I had emailed Silveus earlier asking for his preliminary input, and he said that it was looking as he expected. 

I'm doing some work for data validation, there are some variables on the PSID that seemingly don't track from year to year, and I'm trying to keep track of that 
as well as compiling a list of those instances that my excel sheets that I compiled that track the variables per year are correct, and data display
