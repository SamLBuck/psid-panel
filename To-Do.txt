Confirm family_id format is correct, it usually shows one or two individuals with the same number in that column, Silveus said that it was alright, just wanna look into

Crosswalk Inspection
Mobility Crosswalk was problematic, and now empty. There wasn't a clean variable question for anything other than 2001 if I remember right. The four reasons for leaving

Make some preliminary graphs of the data that might be interesting to the research 

Remind myself of the correct way to track variables per year, go through each crosswalk

Data validation and preliminary graphing of variables of interest to the research

I've been using git version control for this project and for the script that compiles the data set
	I like this because it is easier to display in a project portfolio for software and data jobs, 
	I'm also very familiar with the way that it works

I set up the environment for R and github on this computer, I was mostly using the other one

I ran the script to observe the compiled data, I had emailed Silveus earlier asking for his preliminary input, and he said that it was looking as he expected. 

I'm doing some work for data validation, there are some variables on the PSID that seemingly don't track from year to year, and I'm trying to keep track of that 
as well as compiling a list of those instancesthat my excel sheets that I compiled that track the variables per year are correct, and data display






personally, when I get back I will log my hours, email Baumann, go look for shoes, put my laptop away, check my UND grade when I go to the bathroom, see what wood stain
is food safe and sufficient for the colorado board, eventually start applying to accounting internships, eventually look for apartments, preferably close to 230 fountain
street, eventually tell Ethan about Dune buggies, text Maia's father, eventually finish the bingo application, ask to work four hours, text about potentially hanging out
at Curragh after or before pizza, whatever Ethan prefer, ask Maia Tr to marry me, figure out a co-ed basketball - text Heath,
